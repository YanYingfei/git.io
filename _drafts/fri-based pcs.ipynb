    "## How FRI protocol works\n",
    "A FRI protocol is a protocol for proving that a function $f:H \\to \\mathbf{F}$ is closed to a polynomial of low degree $d$, where $d \\ll |H|$. \n",
    "It can be divided into two phases: commit and query.\n",
    "In the commit phash, the prover commits to (via Merkle trees) a series of functions generated from $f$ and random elements $v_0, v_1, ... $ from $\\mathbf{K}$ provided by the verifier at each round. \n",
    "Then in the query phase, the prover provides a set of evaluations of the previously committed functions at a point randomly chosen by the verifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Commit Phase\n",
    "Denote by $p_0$ the function of low degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query Phase\n",

    "There are two main functions in this code: FriConfig and FriGenericConfig.\n",
    "FriConfig defines the configuration parameters for the FRI protocol, including the blow-up factor (log_blowup), the number of queries(num_queries), and anti-attack parameters(proof_of_work_bits).\n",
    "FriGenericConfig provides an abstract interface for specific implementations of FRI, including fold_row and fold_matrix for folding opreation."
