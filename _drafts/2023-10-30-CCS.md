Recently, I read the new paper KiloNova [<a href="#ref1">1</a>], where the authors propose a PCD scheme based on the CCS relation. Before KiloNova, I would like to list the representations of arithmetic circuits: CCS (and its variants), R1CS, Plonkish and AIR.

## Customizable Constraint Systems



### R1CS

### Plonkish

### AIR
